# Chatbot_Streamlit The "Megiddo Bot" is an interactive chatbot application built using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating web applications. 
This application simulates a basic question-answering chatbot that can respond to user input with predefined responses from a provided dataset. 
The bot utilizes a simple algorithm based on cosine similarity to match user queries with the closest corresponding response from the dataset.
This code serves as the backbone for the chatbot's functionality and user interaction.

The purpose of this application is to showcase a simple implementation of a chatbot that can effectively handle user queries and provide relevant responses based on pre-defined data. 
The primary aim is to demonstrate the utilization of natural language processing techniques, particularly the TfidfVectorizer and cosine similarity functions, to create a basic yet functional chatbot.
Additionally, the application highlights the integration of user-friendly visual elements, such as icons for the user and the bot, making the user experience more engaging and interactive.
